## Phonebook
A simple phonebook SPA application made using Node.js, react, REST, MongoDB, express and react-bootstrap. Application can be used to mangage different peoples names and numbers. You can easily add, update filter and remove numbers from the application. Application uses simple noSQL database to save numbers and names. Database is hosted at MongoDB atlas for free, so it might be little slow. But hey you can't criticise a free meal.
